## Entity Relationship Diagram

This diagram was built using [mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org). It describes all of the tables stored in the database and the attributes for each one of those, as well as the _primary keys_ and _foreign keys_. Each table in the diagram has 4 columns:

1. type
2. attribute
3. PK or FK
4. nullable | default value
